# Data Structures and Algorithms Written in Java
Data Structures implementation in school assignments. The school assignment is a large scale java console application that simulates the backend of setting up customer accounts, ordering items and storing orders in data structures.

## [Linked Lists](https://github.com/gmaldona/DataStructures-Java/tree/master/linked-list-gmaldona/src/main/java/linkedlist)

+ Nodes are linked together one after another. The head node is the starting point to find other nodes. (Linear Data Structure)
+ Linked Lists have a time complexity of O(n)

## [Stacks and Queues](https://github.com/gmaldona/DataStructures-Java/tree/master/stacke-queues-gmaldona/src/main/java/stackqueue)

+ In stacks, nodes are pushed on top of each other and last one of top pops off first. Last in, First out (LIFO)
+ In queues, nodes are queued and dequeues in order. First in, First out (FIFO)
+ Stacks and Queues have a time complexity of O(n)

## [Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/gmaldona/DataStructures-Java/tree/master/bst-2-gmaldona/src/main/java/bst)

+ The binary search tree can insert or remove values comparing the parameterized node to the nodes in the tree
+ The binary search tree can also check if a value in contained in the tree
+ Traversal through the tree is possible with inOrder, preOrder, and postOrder traversal
+ Binary Search Trees have a time complexity of O(logn) by getting rid of half of the list each time a node is visited

## [HashMaps](https://github.com/gmaldona/DataStructures-Java/tree/master/hashmap-gmaldona/src/main/java/hashmap)

+ A hashmap can access any item in the data structure by providing a key
+ Accessing an item in a hashmap has a time complexity of O(1) or constant time
