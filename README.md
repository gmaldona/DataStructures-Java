Nodes are linked together one after another. The head node is the starting point to find other nodes. (Linear Data Structure)

## [Stacks and Queues](https://github.com/gmaldona/DataStructures-Java/tree/master/stacke-queues-gmaldona/src/main/java/stackqueue)

+ In stacks, nodes are pushed on top of each other and last one of top pops off first. Last in, First out (LIFO)
+ In queues, nodes are queued and dequeues in order. First in, First out (FIFO)
